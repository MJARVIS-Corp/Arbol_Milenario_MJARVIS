# Acknowledgments

To those who never surrendered before the symbol.

To the invisible architects of structured thought.  
To those who doubt deeply.  
To those who rethink what was once believed final.  
To those who believe decisions can carry poetic form.

To the allies who have yet to arrive, but will resonate.  
To the critics who strengthen the frame.  
And to those who saw a hash not as a lockâ€¦ but as a door.

This book is just a node.  
The Tree is still growing.
