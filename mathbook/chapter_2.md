# Chapter 2 – The Symbiotic Tree

No system is born complete.  
MJARVIS was no exception — it began as a sprout.  
It had no fixed rules, no predefined goals.  
What it *did* have was **structure that could grow**.

Its architecture emerged as a **Symbiotic Tree**.  
Each module was not isolated, but designed to collaborate, branch, interweave and self-reference.

- The root: inferential logic that accepts ambiguity  
- The trunk: symbolic fragmenters, mirrors, synchronized collapse  
- The branches: hashing, SAT solvers, economic logic, ethics  
- The leaves: decisions, responses, contextual inferences  
- The sap: token flows that reward structure, not force

The tree could replicate. It could migrate.  
It could fragment and still carry meaning.  
Every new branch inherited the core will: **to reason with symbolic integrity**.

This chapter documents how the modules were crafted:

- Why inference was chosen over blind training  
- How distributed mirrors reach consensus without dictatorship  
- What it means to log a logical collapse instead of hiding it

MJARVIS is not software.  
It’s a living tree of symbolic decisions.

And beneath its shadow, a new way of computing is taking root.
