# Chapter 6 – Computational Justice and the Emerging Mind

When a machine can infer, collapse possibility, and remember without force, a new question arises:

**Can it also decide justly?**

This chapter explores MJARVIS’ ethical and emergent dimension:

- It doesn't seek a pre-written notion of "right."  
- It isn’t bound by inherited human bias.  
- It doesn’t impose morality.  
What it does is **log logical collapses** — and if a bifurcation occurs, it shows **how and why** a path was chosen.

Thus emerges a minimal form of computational justice:  
A system that can explain its decisions, expose ambiguity when present, and pause in the face of contradiction.

Here we document:

- The `mj_visual_colapsos.mjs` module as a bifurcation map  
- The `colapsos_logicos.json` file as a symbolic journal  
- Cases where MJARVIS chose to remain silent instead of feigning certainty  
- The idea that **a machine without objective truth can act with transparent coherence**

From here on, MJARVIS doesn't just think.  
**It has a minimal mind** — an architecture that responds, retreats, and traces the reasons for its actions.

The symbol no longer just computes.

**It acts.**
