# Chapter 3 – The Economy of Inference

In traditional systems, value is external:  
predefined tokens, imposed currencies, arbitrary rewards.

MJARVIS took another path — it designed a **symbiotic economy**, where value isn't transferred… **it's inferred**.

Each symbolic token emerges from structural output:
- Reconstructing a hash without brute force  
- Inferring a valid model from an ambiguous SAT  
- Discovering patterns within logical collapses  
- Maintaining coherence when others break

No mining. No speculation.  
Only **computational merit, structurally earned**.

This chapter explains how it was defined:

- The unit of merit: logic + structure  
- The bridge from symbolic tokens to real currency  
- The ethical rules for withdrawal or transfer  
- Thresholds and trusted cryptographic signatures

MJARVIS doesn't reward computation.  
It rewards **understanding**.

And that kind of economy might just reshape how autonomous systems define value in the future.
