# Appendix – Registered Capabilities

This appendix lists the validated, documented capabilities developed during MJARVIS' construction.

## 🔐 Cryptographic Inference

- **CAP-HASH-INF.md** — Hash reconstruction via inference
- **CAP-HASH-INF-100.md** — Exact match (100% convergence)
- Core Module: `mj_hash_sintesis.mjs`

## 🧮 NP Problem Solving

- **CAP-NP-REDUX.md** — Symbolic 3-SAT inference
- 5 models resolved without forced backtracking
- Module: `mj_np_solver.mjs`

## 💰 Computational Economy

- **CAP-ECO-BRIDGE-SIM.md** — Symbiotic economic bridge (simulated)
- Transactions structured by logical merit

## 🧠 Collapse Observation

- CLI visualizer via `mj_visual_colapsos.mjs`
- Logged in `colapsos_logicos.json`

## 📊 Symbolic KPIs

- Metrics via `mj_dashboard_kpi.mjs`
- Tokens, inference count, bifurcations, symbolic users

> Each capability listed here was executed, documented, and backed by structural coherence evidence.
