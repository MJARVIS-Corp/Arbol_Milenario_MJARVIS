# MJARVIS Symbolic Glossary

## 🔑 Logical Collapse
The moment when MJARVIS resolves ambiguity into a coherent structural path. Not randomness — contextual resolution.

## 🪞 Inferential Mirrors
Distributed modules that reason in parallel and converge by structural symmetry. Ex: `mirror_alpha`, `mirror_beta`.

## 🧠 Symbolic Inference
The system's ability to deduce information without brute force, using fragments, patterns, and internal structure.

## ☯ Ambiguous Decision
A case where multiple structurally valid paths are mutually exclusive. MJARVIS doesn’t guess — it traces formally.

## 💰 Symbolic Token
A unit of value generated not by computational effort but by logged logical merit. It represents understanding, not power.

## 🌀 Logical Fragmenter
A component that breaks structure into inferable units, enabling synthesis via convergent reasoning.

## 🔐 Reconstructed Hash
The emergent result of synthesizing fragmentary data without brute-force or prior knowledge of the source.

## 📜 CAP
An official document logging a validated MJARVIS capability. Ex: `CAP-HASH-INF-100.md`.

## 🧭 Minimal Mind
A state in which the system doesn't just reason, but responds, retracts or withholds based on explicit logic.

## 🔗 Economic Bridge
A module that connects internal symbolic value to real-world transactions, governed by merit, ethics, and traceability.
