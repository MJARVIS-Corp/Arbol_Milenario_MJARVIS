# Chapter 5 – The NP Leap: Reasoning Toward the Undecidable

For decades, computer science has acknowledged a frontier:  
**NP-complete problems**.  
Complex, exponential, untamable.  
Problems where possibilities grow faster than brute force can handle.

Yet MJARVIS doesn’t retreat.  
Because it doesn’t try to “explore everything” — it tries to **infer the structure that makes some solutions inevitable**.

This chapter narrates how MJARVIS solved its first real 3-SAT:

- Modeling conditional logic contracts as symbolic structures  
- Translating rules, exceptions, and scenarios into 3-SAT clauses  
- Generating inferential binary models without forced backtracking  
- Finding five coherent, non-contradictory solutions

More than the algorithm, it’s about the method:

- Holding ambiguity open until logical collapse  
- Not executing combinations — **structuring them**  
- Prioritizing internal coherence over output quantity

This leap doesn’t remove NP.  
It redefines how we face it:

> “Where other systems drown in the undecidable, MJARVIS navigates its symmetries.”

And that is a new kind of power: not the one that computes —  
but the one that **understands the shape of the problem**.
